CTdiagnosis
===========
This is a software of lung cancer diagnosis. As part of a computer aided diagnosis(CAD) system, this software aims to assist doctocs make a diagnosis of lung cancer by analysing the Computed Tomography(CT) images. 
Based on the technology of Digital Image Processing and Machine Learning,we calculate(predict) the probability of a person suffering from lung cancer.
All CT images are firstly pre-processed and partitioned into regions via Region growing algorithm, and then Fast Discrete Curvelet Transforms(FDCT) Algorithm is applied to extract the most 14 distinctive features from the pre-processed image. Finally the extracted features ,labels together with their corresponding patient's info are trained by Support Vector Machine(SVM).Once the Lung cancer model is established, it could tell the probability of a patient suffering from lung cancer with his info and CT images sequence.With the increased use of this software the prediction accuracy is improved continuously.
